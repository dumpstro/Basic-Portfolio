            <p>I am an experienced quality assurance analyst with a history of delivering builds on time without compromised quality. I am well versed with acceptance testing on PC, Mac, web, Android, and iOS. I used Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) standards and communicated with project/product managers and developers as part of an Agile workgroup. Previously, Iâ€™ve performed functionality, stress, and regression testing as lead on a new company-wide lead-generation vertical. I also worked as part of a small department on Quicken Willmaker Plus, a legal software with millions of copies sold and rigorous requirements for output and performance.</p>
            <p>My aim is to transition into a role as an automation engineer, increase my knowledge of javascript and MySQL, and continue supporting quality products.</p>
            <p>On the weekends you can find me in my backyard on a trampoline with my kids.</p>
